# WebDAV Push

Here we want to draft a document describing WebDAV Push, primarily intended for CalDAV/CardDAV Push.

The CalDAV/CardDAV Push function shall allow servers (like Nextcloud) to notify clients about updates in subscribed collections (address books, calendars) so that clients (like DAVx‚Åµ) can synchronize and download these updates prompty.
