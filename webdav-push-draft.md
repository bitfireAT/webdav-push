WebDAV-Push â€“ Draft Document (In Work)



# Introduction

This document, below referred to as _WebDAV-Push_, provides a way for compliant WebDAV servers to send notifications about updated collections to subscribed clients over suitable push transports.

WebDAV-Push is intended as an additional tool to notify clients about updates in near time so that clients can refresh their views, perform synchronization etc.

A client should not rely solely on WebDAV-Push, so it should also perform regular polling like when WebDAV-Push is not available. However if WebDAV-Push is available, the polling frequency can be
significantly reduced.

Typical use cases:

- A mobile app synchronizes calendars/address books with device-local storage and wants to be notified on collection updates in order to re-synchronize.
- A desktop file manager shows contents of a WebDAV collection and wants to be notified on updates in order to refresh the view.
- A calendar Web app shows a CalDAV collection and wants to be notified on updates in order to refresh the view.

## Terminology

_(Push) backend:_ Part of a WebDAV-Push server that interacts with a specific push transport. In context of this document, there's only one backend for Web Push.

_Push notification:_ push message or delivery of a push message

_Push message:_ Actual network message that is sent from the WebDAV-Push server over a push service to the WebDAV-Push client. Notifies the client that a specific collection (identified by its push topic) has changed.

In Web Push context, a server can send a push message (more exact, "request delivery of a push message") by `POST`ing the message to the client's subscription URL.

_Push service:_ Infrastructure that implements a specific push transport. The push service is the actual network service between WebDAV-Push server and WebDAV-Push client. For instance, if the push transport is Web Push and the client is a Web app, the push service would be provided by the vendor of the browser that the client runs in.

_(Push) subscription (URL)_: The information that the client needs to provide to the server so that the server can send push notifications.

If the transport is Web Push, the term _(push) subscription (URL)_ as used in this document is equivalent to the Web Push term _push resource_. So for instance, a client could have connected to its Web Push service and receive `https://push.example.net/push/JzLQ3raZJfFBR0aqvOMsLrt54w4rJUsV` as the subscription URL.

_(Push) topic:_ Character sequence that identifies a WebDAV collection for push purposes (unique per WebDAV server). A specific collection could be reachable at different URLs, but it can only have one push topic.

_(Push) transport:_ Protocol that defines an actual push mechanism. In this document, Web Push is the only defined push transport. However, WebDAV-Push may also be used with other push transports like proprietary or yet unknown protocols. In that case, it has to be specified how to use that protocol with WebDAV-Push (like it's done for Web Push in Appendix A). A push transport implementation may or may not involve a push service.

_Rewrite proxy:_ Push services sometimes require authentication from their users and consider their user to be an application vendor who has control over both the server and the client. For instance, a push service could be used by the vendor of a weather app who controls both the servers that deliver weather data and the clients, which are mobile apps that show the weather data. Both servers and clients can authenticate against the push service with the same private key.

When however the server and clients are not in control of the same entity, like when the server is a WebDAV-Push server and the client is a mobile app that is not related to the server vendor, client and server can't have the same private key to authenticate against the push service. In that case, the client vendor may need to operate a rewrite proxy that receives each push message delivery request from a server, sign it with the same private key as the client and forwards it to the push service.

_UnifiedPush:_ Implementation of Web Push that is not bound to browsers or infrastructure of browser vendors. Can be used by desktop and mobile applications and with various custom (also self-hosted) push services.

_W3C Push API:_ API for Web applications to use push notifications over Web Push

_Web Push:_ "protocol for the delivery of real-time events to user agents", defined by RFC 8030. Usually implemented in browsers (which means that major browser vendors provide their own push services), but there are also other implementations like UnifiedPush. Some parts of RFC 8030 (namely chapter 6 and HTTP/2 delivery between push service and client) specify implementation details that may be done by other means without changing the meaning of the RFC for WebDAV-Push servers and clients. There are also additional standards that can be considered to belong to Web Push (like VAPID, RFC 8292 and Message Encryption, RFC 8291).

_WebDAV-Push:_ WebDAV-based protocol to notify clients about updates in collections using a push transport (vs. polling)

_(WebDAV-Push) client:_ WebDAV client that supports WebDAV-Push, for instance a CalDAV/CardDAV app on a mobile device

_(WebDAV-Push) server:_ WebDAV server (for instance a CalDAV/CardDAV server) that implements WebDAV-Push


## WebDAV server with support for WebDAV-Push

A WebDAV server that implements WebDAV-Push needs to

- advertise WebDAV-Push features and relevant information (service detection),
- manage subscriptions to collections and
- send push messages when a subscribed collection changes.

In order to manage subscriptions, a WebDAV server needs to

- provide a way for clients to subscribe to a collection (with transport-specific information),
- provide a way for clients to unsubscribe from collections,
- handle expired or otherwise invalid subscriptions.

Notifications about updates in collections have to be sent to all subscribed clients over the respective push transports.

The server must be prepared to handle errors. For instance, if a push transport signals that a subscription doesn't exist anymore, it must be removed and not be used again.


## WebDAV client with support for WebDAV-Push

A WebDAV client that implements WebDAV-Push typically

- detects whether the server supports WebDAV-Push and which push transports,
- connects to a service (which is usually not operated by the WebDAV server provider),
- subscribes to one or more collections on the server (and thus provides information about its push service),
- receives push notifications that cause some client-side action (like to refresh the view or run synchronization),
- re-subscribes to collections before the subscriptions expire,
- unsubscribes from collections when notifications are not needed anymore.


## Push transports

WebDAV-Push is not restricted to specific push transports and allows clients to specify which push transports they support. This allows even upcoming, yet unknown push transports to be used with 
WebDAV-Push.

WebDAV-Push implementations _should_ implement at least Web Push / RFC 8030 (see Appendix A).

For proprietary push services, client vendors may need to provide a _rewrite proxy_ that signs and forwards the requests to the respective proprietary service.

Push transport definitions can define extra properties and additional processing rules. For instance, a transport definition could define that WebDAV servers should send an additional 
`Topic` header with their push notifications so that previous undelivered push messages are replaced by new ones.



# Service detection

How clients can detect

- whether a collection supports WebDAV-Push,
- which push services are supported (may contain service-specific information)

**Element definitions:**

Name: `push-transports`  
Namespace: `DAV:Push`  
Purpose: Indicates which push transports are supported by the server.  
Definition: `<!ELEMENT push-transports (transport*)`  
Example: see below

Name: `transport`  
Namespace: `DAV:Push`  
Purpose: Specifies a push transport (like Web Push).  
Definition: `<!ELEMENT transport (web-push | %other-transport)`  
Example: see below

Name: `topic`  
Namespace: `DAV:Push`  
Purpose: Globally unique identifier for the collection.  
Description:

Notification messages contain the topic of the collection so that the client knows which collection has changed. (URLs are not generally canonical, so that the collection URL without an explicit topic would not be enough.)

Because the topic may be sent over push transports without encryption, it should not allow to draw conclusions about the synchronized collection.

A client may register the same subscription for collections from multiple servers. When the client receives a notification over such a shared subscription, the topic can be used to distinguish which collection was updated. Because the client must be able to distinguish between collections from different servers, the topics need to be globally unique.

(Because the topic is used as `Topic` header when sent over a Web Push transport, the topic should follow the rules of the RFC 8030 `Topic` header: no more than 32 characters from the URL and
filename-safe Base64 alphabet.) OR Create Hash for Web-Push?

For instance, a server could use as a topic:

* a random GUID, encoded with base64url (defined in RFC 4648), for each collection; or
* a salted hash (constant server-specific salt) of the canonical collection URL, encoded with base64url.

Definition: `<!ELEMENT topic (#PCDATA)`  
Example: `<P:topic>O7M1nQ7cKkKTKsoS_j6Z3w</P:topic>`

Example:

```
PROPFIND https://example.com/webdav/collection/
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<propfind xmlns="DAV:" xmlns:P="DAV:Push">
  <prop>
    <P:push-transports/>
    <P:topic/>
  </prop>
</propfind>

HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<multistatus xmlns="DAV:" xmlns:P="DAV:Push">
  <response>
    <href>/webdav/collection/</href>
    <prop>
      <P:push-transports>
        <P:transport><P:web-push /></P:transport>
        <P:transport>
          <P:some-other-transport>
            <P:some-relevant-info>...<P:some-relevant-info>
          </P:some-other-transport>
        </P:transport>
      </P:push-transports>
      <P:topic>O7M1nQ7cKkKTKsoS_j6Z3w</P:topic>
    </prop>
  </response>
</multistatus>
```

In this case, the requested collection supports two push transports:

1. Web Push (RFC 8030)
2. Some other transport, with some additional relevant information that is required to use it. This is to illustrate that it WebDAV-Push aims to support other or even yet unknown push transports,
   too.



# Subscription management


## Subscription registration

How to subscribe to collections on the WebDAV server. Required information:

- Collection to be subscribed
- Push transport, including transport-specific details
    - Web Push: push resource URL
    - (TODO details for message encryption)
- Expiration? how long by default, min/max (24 h), server decides (and can impose limits)
- (End-to-end-encryption? Or should it be defined per transport?)

TODO By now, only updates in direct members (equals `Depth: 1`) are sent. Maybe it could be specified that servers can send one notification per path segment? Implications?

To subscribe to a collection, the client sends a POST request with
`Content-Type: application/xml` to the collection it wants to subscribe. The root XML element of the XML body is `<push-register>` in the WebDAV-Push name space (`DAV:Push`) and can be used to distinguish between a WebDAV-Push and other requests.


## Subscription updates

A server must not register a subscription with the same identifier multiple times. Which field is used as a unique identifier is specific to the transport. For Web Push, it is the push 
resource URL.

If a client tries to register a subscription with the same identifier again, the server must update the stored subscription with the subscription details and the expiration date. The server
can return either the same or a new registration URL for the updated subscription.


## Element definitions

Name: `push-register`  
Namespace: `DAV:Push`  
Purpose: Indicates that a subscription shall be registered to receive notifications when the collection is updated.  
Description:

This element specifies details about a subscription that shall be notified when the collection is updated. Besides the optional expiration, there must be exactly one `subscription` element that
defines the subscription details.

Definition: `<!ELEMENT push-register (expires?, subscription)`  
Example: see below

Name: `subscription`  
Namespace: `DAV:Push`  
Purpose: Specifies a subscription that shall be notified on updates. Contains exactly one element with details about a specific subscription type. In this document, only the `web-push-subscription` child element is defined.  
Definition: `<!ELEMENT subscription (web-push-subscription | %other-subscription)`  
Example: `<expires>Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT</expires>`

Name: `expires`  
Namespace: `DAV:Push`  
Purpose: Specifies an expiration date of the registered subscription.  
Description: Specifies an expiration date-time in the `IMF-fixdate` format (RFC 9110).  
Definition: `<!ELEMENT expires (#PCDATA)`  
Example: `<expires>Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT</expires>`

Allowed response codes:

* 201 if the subscription was created. The server may return additional information, like encryption details that are only valid for this subscription. Details have to be specified by the particular transport definition.
* other error code (should include `DAV:error` XML body)

When registering a subscription, the server creates a URL that identifies that registration (_registration URL_). That URL is sent in the `Location` header and can be used to remove the
subscription.

Sample request for Web Push without message encryption:

```
POST https://example.com/webdav/collection/
Content-Type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<push-register xmlns="DAV:Push">
  <subscription>
    <web-push-subscription>
      <push-resource>https://up.example.net/yohd4yai5Phiz1wi</push-resource>
    </web-push-subscription>
  </subscription>
  <expires>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 10:03:31 GMT</expires>
</push-register>

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://example.com/webdav/subscriptions/io6Efei4ooph
```


## Subscription removal

A client can explicitly request subscription removal (unsubscribe) by sending a `DELETE` request to its registration URL.

Sample request:

```
DELETE https://example.com/webdav/subscriptions/io6Efei4ooph

HTTP/1.1 204 OK
```


## Expiration

Clients can specify an expiration date-time when they register a subscription.

A server should take the expiration specified by a client into consideration, but may impose its own (often stricter) expiration rules, for instance to keep their database clean or because the
client has specified an implausible late expiration.

Clients should refresh their registrations regularly because they can't rely on servers to keep their subscriptions until the client-specified expiration date.

Expired subscriptions should be cleaned up and not be used anymore as chances are high that notifying such subscriptions will cause errors.



# Push notification

When content of direct members change. What is this exactly?

Data vs. metadata, only about members or also the subscribed collection itself? CalDAV/CardDAV: subscribe home-set?

Typically when CTag / sync-token changes.


## Push message

The push message body contains the topic of the changed collection.

Sample push message body:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<push-message xmlns="DAV:Push">
  <topic>O7M1nQ7cKkKTKsoS_j6Z3w</topic>
</push-message>
```

Push notification rate limit?

Shall end-to-end encryption (for instance as described by RFC 8291) be possible / recommended /
required?

Shall a TTL value, as used by Web Push, be recommended in general, per transport, or not at all?

Shall multiple enqueued (and not yet delivered) push messages for the same collection be merged to a
single one (like _Replacing push messages_ with the `Topic` header in RFC 8030)? Maybe use a
timestamp? Shall this be specified in general, per transport or not at all?

CTag?

How often / batch / delay?

Expiration ...

# Security considerations

Which information is shared with which party, especially public ones like the Google FCM +
implications? Involved parties:

* WebDAV server
* client
* push transports

Without E2EE, push transports can collect metadata:

* which WebDAV server notifies which clients,
* which clients are subscribed to the same collection (because they receive the same topic in the
  push message),
* at which times the collection is changed,
* other metadata (IP addresses etc.)

With E2EE, every push message is different and push transports can only relate clients over
heuristics, like the clients that are notified at the same time have probably subscribed the same
collection.

How sensitive are the data, how to minimize risks

What happens when information leaks

What happens when some component is hacked



# Appendix A: Web Push Transport

WebDAV-Push can be used with Web Push (RFC 8030) to deliver WebDAV-Push notifications directly to
compliant user agents, like Web browsers which come with their own push service infrastructure.
Currently (2024), all major browsers support Web Push.

When the Web Push transport is used for WebDAV-Push:

* RFC 8030 defines how to generate subscriptions and send push messages,
* the WebDAV-Push server acts as RFC 8030 Application Server,
* the WebDAV client (or a proxy server, for instance for proprietary environments) acts as RFC 8030
  User Agent.

Usage of Message Encryption (RFC 8291) and VAPID (RFC 8292) is recommended. If future protocol
extensions become used by push services, WebDAV-Push servers should implement them as well, if
applicable.

A WebDAV-Push server should use the collection topic as `Topic` header in push messages to replace
previous notifications for the same collection.

> **NOTE**: [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org/) (UP) is a set of specification documents which
> are intentionally designed as a 100% compatible subset of Web Push, together with a software that
> can be used to implement these documents. From a WebDAV-Push server perspective, UP endpoints can be
> seen as Web Push resources.

![Flowchart: WebDAV-Push over UnifiedPush](images/unifiedpush-flowchart.png)


## Subscription

Element definitions:

Name: `web-push`  
Purpose: Specifies the Web Push transport.  
Description: Used to specify the Web Push Transport in the context of a `<transport>` element, for
instance in a list of supported transports.  
Definition: `<!ELEMENT web-push (EMPTY)`  
Example: `<web-push/>`

Name: `web-push-subscription`  
Purpose: Public information of a Web Push subscription that is shared with the WebDAV-Push server
(in terms of RFC 8030: application server).  
Description: Used to specify a Web Push subscription in the context of a `<subscription>` element,
for instance to register a subscription.  
Definition: `<!ELEMENT web-push-subscription (push-resource)`  
Example: see below

Name: `push-resource`  
Purpose: Identifies the endpoint where Web Push notifications are sent to (in terms of RFC 8030:
push resource). The push resource is used as the unique identifier for the subscription.  
Definition: `<!ELEMENT push-resource (#PCDATA)`  
Example:

```
<web-push-subscription xmlns="DAV:Push">
  <push-resource>https://push.example.net/push/JzLQ3raZJfFBR0aqvOMsLrt54w4rJUsV</push-resource>
</web-push-subscription>
```

### Message encryption

> **TODO:** message encryption as defined in RFC 8291


## Push message

The push topic _should_ be used to generate the `Topic` header. Since RFC 8030 limits the `Topic` header to 32 characters from the URL and filename-safe Base64 alphabet, it's _recommended_ to use a hash of the push topic that meets these requirements as the header value.

The exact algorithm to derive the `Topic` header from the push topic can be chosen by the server.

Example:

Push topic: `O7M1nQ7cKkKTKsoS_j6Z3w`  
SHA1(push topic): `47788cfcf010ece3030175b8fa63276bbaea4862`  
As base64url: `R3iM_PAQ7OMDAXW4-mMna7rqSGI`

(Note that SHA1 doesn't serve a cryptographical purpose here and is just used to generate a fixed-length hash out of the variable-length topic.)

So push message delivery is requested with this header:

```
POST <push subscription URL>
Topic: R3iM_PAQ7OMDAXW4-mMna7rqSGI

<push message>
```
